"""Object thumbnails and per-object timelines for a demonstration.

One Meta call finds each object on the first frame, and SAM follows those boxes
through a low frame rate copy of the recording. When some object is not on the
first frame, or SAM stopped following one the analysis still uses later, a
second call looks at a few later stills chosen from the analysis, and a second
SAM request follows those boxes forward. Each box is then checked against DINOv2
appearance references (appearance_stage.py): a demonstration learns them here, an attempt
reads its procedure's. A rejected box stays in raw_tracks.json and is not drawn. No box
decides a verdict. A failure leaves the analysis in place.
