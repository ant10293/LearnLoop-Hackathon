"""Appearance galleries for learned procedures: status, and the job that builds a missing one.

A gallery belongs to the demonstration analysis a procedure was learned from, so
every version of that procedure reads the same references. It is usually built
while the demonstration's object views are made. Learning a procedure makes sure
it exists: when it does not, one queued job rebuilds it from the stored SAM and
locate answers. That job sends nothing to a provider.
